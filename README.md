# Hello!

Iâ€™m Denis (he/him). I am a software engineer first and foremost, but also a writer of fiction and non-fiction, a game developer, and a public speaker.

Check out [my web site](https://denisdefreyne.com/) and in particular [my weeknotes](https://denisdefreyne.com/weeknotes/), which I publish every Sunday, on a variety of topics (software development included).

Iâ€™m open to new opportunities this very moment. [Read more about what I offer and what I am seeking.](https://denisdefreyne.com/notes/get-me-a-job-2025/)
