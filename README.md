## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Denis. I have made a handful of open-source software, most notably [Nanoc](https://nanoc.app/), which I still use frequently, over 18 years since its first release.

Check out [my web site](https://denisdefreyne.com/) and in particular [my weeknotes](https://denisdefreyne.com/weeknotes/), which I publish every Sunday, on a variety of topics (software development included).

Iâ€™m open to new opportunities this very moment. [Read more about what I offer and what I am seeking.](https://denisdefreyne.com/notes/get-me-a-job-2025/)
