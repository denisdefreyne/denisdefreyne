## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Denis ([he/him](https://denisdefreyne.com/notes/my-pronouns/)), and software development is one of my primary skills. My areas of expertise include backend development (mostly Ruby/Rails), frontend (mostly React/TypeScript), CLI tools, and a variety of other things.

I have made a handful of open-source software, most notably [Nanoc](https://nanoc.app/), which I still use frequently, over 18 years since its first release.

Check out [my web site](https://denisdefreyne.com/) and in particular [my weeknotes](https://denisdefreyne.com/weeknotes/), which I publish every Sunday, on a variety of topics (software development included).

Do [leave me a message](https://denisdefreyne.com/contact/)!
